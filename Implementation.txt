1. Quicksort

The parallel quicksort implementation will first check how many threads are available on the system. Each thread will be assigned a fraction of the array to be sorted and will quicksort that fraction.
These fractions will be internally sorted, but the entire array is not yet sorted. To solve this,the fractions are merged on a single thread. After the merge, the entire array will be sorted.
